# Contributing

Contributions should be proposed and discussed using the feature request or bug report issue template. New code is to be reviewed via a pull request in order to be added to develop.

## Code Style
Pull requests must adhere to style guidelines enforced by a variety of tools. Departures from the style (i.e. noqa comments) must be justified. The formatters and linters used by this repository are:

- Black formatter (88 column line default)
- Ruff linter

- Commit message requirements: Must take the form `Issue #XXX: Commit message`, not exceeding 72 characters.

It is recommended to install these tools in the editor of your choice and have them warn for noncompliance and apply autofixes on save.
